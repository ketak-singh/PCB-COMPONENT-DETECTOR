# IOT SOLUTION TO DETECTING MISSING COMPONENT IN MOSFET DRIVER CIRCUIT PCB BOARDS


## Objectives:
To avoid any process failure due to missing components in a MOSFET DRIVER CIRCUIT PCB


## Methododolgy:

1) Data collection OF SINGLE LAYER PCB BOARDS

2) Block diagram development

3) Model training and Testing using data with different algorithms

4) App development to notify the user about the defect in the PCB board.



## DESIGN: (SIMULATION)

1)A MOBILE APP TO SEND PICTURE OF PCB TO CLOUD
2)CLOUD HAS A IMAGE PROCESSING CODE TO DETECT MISSING COMPONENTS WITH THEIR LOCATION 
3)CLOUD WILL SEND NOTIFICATION BACK TO USER THROUGH MOBILE APP
